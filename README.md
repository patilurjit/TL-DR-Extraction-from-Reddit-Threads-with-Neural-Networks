# TL-DR-Extraction-from-Reddit-Threads-with-Neural-Networks
This project addresses the challenge of text summarization in Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on generating concise TL;DR (too long; did not read) summaries for Reddit posts. It proposes implementing neural network models by utilizing the 'Summarize from Feedback' dataset from Hugging Face, comprising around 179k Reddit posts and corresponding summaries. The project begins with baseline models employing extractive methods and then advances to sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms. It also explores pre-trained language models for enhanced contextual understanding. The effectiveness of the developed models will be quantitatively evaluated using the ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) score, encompassing ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L metrics.
