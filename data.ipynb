This will be the second time I have actually been with him in person. I am flying from the UK with my mum to the east coast. The original plan was for me to fly over to my boyfriend in the west coast (my parents are holidaying on the east coast) but because my mum was freaking out so much about me going to meet my boyfriend i said we can all road trip there together. I even invited her on the trip with us. I have given her all of our dates so that she can travel around with us.\\n\\nThe plan was for me to stay on the 4th July and fly back on the 5th. Mum knew this. I told her I had booked a flight back already from the west coast to east coast (where she would pick me up and we would fly back to the UK together). She has gone mad at me because she can't believe I would book a flight when she told me she didn't want me flying on my own. At the time I had booked it she told me she wasn't gonna road trip with us. She knew the trip was happening.......how else was I to get home if I don't fly? \\n\\nI am fine flying on my own it doesn't bother me at all. I feel like I have done everything I can to make her feel comfortable with this trip and she is just trying to sabotage it. Thoughts??\""

He told her he was going back to fill the prescription but instead called me hoping I would be able to remedy the situation without him having to call the police on her. I am eternally grateful for nice neighbors. I left work and went there, found her in the waiting area and explained the situation at hand. She started screaming at me and was causing a big scene for the twelve people that were there shopping at noon on a Wednesday. I was able to convince her to leave with me, telling her we'd find another way to get the pills. \n",

Cue lots more screaming and her calling the police on me, she arrived at a much better decision. She would go to rehab as long as it was a place of her choosing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday morning we arrived here and parted ways in the afternoon when we checked her in. Right now they have a 90 day program set in place and then I guess we go from there. I am apparently not allowed to have contact with her for the first week as she goes through the withdrawal process. I'm not thrilled about that or that I won't be able to come back to visit her until the first 30 days are up. \n",

I know Garda is going to be even more distraught without her than I am, so I'd like to take him out there with me next month.
