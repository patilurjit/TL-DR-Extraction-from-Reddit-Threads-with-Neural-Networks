"First things first - yes we're teenagers, young and immature or whatever. Please help me out anyways ok? 

So. There was this girl I had a crush on since freshman year of high school. We have been really good friends since then and she means a lot to me. This summer I decided nothing was going to happen, because it had already been over a year and nothing happened. 

After I made this decision, I met another girl over summer. She was really pretty, and I got her number. I asked her out, and we've been together for a little over two months. (Now, I also know this is not a long relationship. I understand that.) I love her. She's been amazing to me, so nice and caring and just seems like the perfect girl.

But I have recently been told that the girl I had a long crush on, the first girl, is heartbroken that I'm with this new girl and it breaks her heart a little more each time she sees me, because she loves me. Her friend told me this. And finding this out broke my heart, I felt so bad because I liked her too.

Finding this out has made me think that I could make her happy by breaking up with my girlfriend and going with her. But I could never do that to my girlfriend, I love her.

Does anyone have advice? I can answer any questions.", Two months into relationship and I found out that the girl I have a crush on for a long time is heartbroken that I'm with someone else.
"My partner's cousin, E, often invites us over for dinner. This is a very nice gesture and we have been many times. I like to spend time with E and her family. The problem is that my boyfriend B and I have gotten explosive diarrhea from E's meals on more than one occasion.

It has happened at least 3-4 times now and we are starting to see the pattern. E doesn't seem to have a very good understanding of safe food handling. For example, I have seen her serve appetizers to people when they have been sitting out for several hours. Also I once saw her leave some steaks on the counter for almost 4 hours (!!!) before cooking them. I know that it is good to let steak rest at room temperature for a short time before cooking them, but definitely not for 4 hours! Both me and B have had the shits so bad from E's meals that we have had to miss work. It doesn't seem as though E, her husband [29m] or kids [3&5m] ever really get sick like we do, perhaps they are just used to it.

I really don't know how to approach this issue. We do not want to stop hanging out with E and her family because they are good friends (not to mention B is related to them of course). It is really nice of her to always be inviting us for dinner and I don't know how we can tell her about this issue without sounding rude."," Partner's cousin and her husband frequently invite us over for dinner, one time we have gotten sick from eating at their house. How do we tell her without seeming rude?"
"It was my 21st birthday. My gf went with me to a strip club... first strip club i've ever been to in my life. We both get completely shit faced and head back to her place. Drunk as fuck we both pass out. I woke up in the middle of the night and began to make out with her because i was horny as fuck... and my buzz was wearing off. She began to kiss back and was giving me a HJ... so I figured she wanted it bad. We began to get our sex on and I noticed she was REALLY wet.... So dumbass me thinks that i've made her horny as fuck. So here I am thinking i'm the god of sex... and we both finish. Wake up the next morning with a nasty hangover.... and i noticed that my hand was covered in something dark and red. At this moment... i realized something horrible. I removed the sheets only to find out she was on her period the whole time. Her sheets, pants, my pants, and pillows were RUINED. What felt like an awesome sex experience turned out to be the worst thing that has ever happened to me.
